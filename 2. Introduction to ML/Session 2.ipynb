    "# Session 1: Introduction to ML\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture covers the basics of ML and provides an overview of how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "* Install Processing and Wekinator, and the required libraries\n",
    "* Choosing input and output data for training\n",
    "* Understanding training procedure\n",
    "* Build a basic interactive model using Processing and Wekinator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Required tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by installing __Processing__ (https://processing.org/download/) and choosing the distribution matching your operating system (currently we using version 3.4). Unzip it and create a shortcut of the application (incase of Windows users), or just copy it to the Application folder (incase of Mac users). \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure Processing is working and no errors are reported when you start it. Run an example program by choosing (File --> Examples), and select one of the pre-loaded examples such as (Topics --> Interaction --> Follow 1). Program window will appear, and you can run it by hitting Play button on the top left corner or by choosing from the menu Sketch --> Run. A new window will appear with an interactive content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries Installation\n",
    "Next, we will install some libraries that will help us to use new functions by Processing. To add new library, select from menu (Sketch --> Import Library --> Add Library). This will show a list of libraries developed by others which you can add to your PC. We will be using the following libraries:\n",
    "* __OscP5__: used as communication protocol for sending and receiving data with other applications\n",
    "* __ControlP5__: used to create Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n",
    "* __Minim__: a library to manage audio\n",
    "* __Video__: used to capture built-in camera images\n",
    "\n",
    "Install each of these libraries as we will need them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Libraries](Images/Processing_1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wekinator:\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will install __Wekinator__ (http://www.wekinator.org/downloads/) and choosing the distribution matching your operating system (currently we using version 2.1.0.4). Install it, and make sure it can run without issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wekinator starts with a window asking for the type of model used, input and output parameters. These parameters are dependant on the target application you are developing, and type of data used. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing input and output data for training\n",
    "\n",
    "Wekinator has a wide set of examples to get you started to interface with it (http://www.wekinator.org/examples/). There are two types of example bundles in this page: Input and Output. \n",
    "![Traing and Inference flow](Images/Wekinator_1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> __Input__ refers to the application that will generate the data to be used for training, and for inference. This application will send the data as a vector with specific length related to the type of input used. For example, for using the Mouse motion as input to the training application, we can send a data vector of two values for the (X and Y) motion of the mouse. If we want to include the mouse click (e.g. left button) then we need to send a data vector of three values: (X, Y, Left Button). These data should be encoded as numbers (floating point).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> __Output__ refers to the application that receives the result data after the ML model is trained. For example, for output application that plays audio file, it can use as inference a vector of two values (volume, pitch) that controls audio playback. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use for Input: [Mouse motion input example bundle](./Sketches/Simple_MouseXY_2Inputs/Simple_MouseXY_2Inputs.pde), and for output: [FM Synthesis example](./Sketches/Processing_FMSynth_3ContinuousOutputs/Processing_FMSynth_3ContinuousOutputs.pde)\n",
    "\n",
    "Download these two sketches, open them in Processing, and run them. The input example will capture mouse motion (X,Y) and send it to Wekinator, while the FMSynth will expect to receive three values to control audio (Frequency, Amplitude, Offset). So far running these applications will have no effect since they need to be linked together by teaching Wekinator model to map mouse motion with specific control values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Start up Wekinator, and set the #inputs to 2, and #outputs to 3. Keep other values to default and hit \"Next >\" button\n",
    "![FM Audio Synesis](Images/Wekinator_2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The training interface will contain three sliders equivalent to the number of outputs specified. Changing these sliders will technically send control values to the audio application. We will use these to __specify what we are intending to learn__ for specific mouse coordinates. Hit \"Start Recording\" button to start collecting samples, set the first slider to one, while the other two sliders to zero, and start moving the mouse on the top left corner of the Mouse application. This will start sending training input samples to Wekinator for the specific output sliders. Keep moving the mouse in small motion until you see the number of examples reach around 50. Repeat this with different sliders positions and make sure to change the position of the mouse in the window for that slider position. Each time make sure you get around 50 samples at least.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Collecting Samples](Images/Wekinator_3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally hit \"Train\" button, and then \"Run\" button to start getting inference of the mouse motion. Now when you move the mouse coordinate you will notice the audio changes accordingly.\n",

    "## Processing and Wekinator:\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing is a great tool to create basic interactive applications. \n",
    "When creating an app for machine learning, its important to understand how many inputs your data will generate, and thus the model should accept the same number of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for simple mouse coordinate, there are two inputs: X and Y coordinates of the mouse.\n",
    "Another example for camera as input, images are represented by pixels and color. Image for example is 320x240 with R,G,B colors. Thus total number of inputs are: 320(width) x 240(height) x 3(color)=230,400 inputs. We will talk more about data in later session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, number of outputs should be defined. For example, if the program should only classify input, the number of outputs are defined by the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, two input programs were created:\n",
    "<br> 1- [Mouse motion input example bundle](./Sketches/Simple_MouseXY_2Inputs/Simple_MouseXY_2Inputs.pde): Has two inputs\n",
    "<br> 2- [Camera input example bundle](./Sketches/Camera_Input_625Outputs/Camera_Input_625Outputs.pde): Has 25x25 inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: Camera is not possible to use with Processing runnung under Catalina OSX!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and for output: \n",
    "<br> - [FM Synthesis example](./Sketches/Processing_FMSynth_3ContinuousOutputs/Processing_FMSynth_3ContinuousOutputs.pde): accepts 3 outputs to generate audio sound."
